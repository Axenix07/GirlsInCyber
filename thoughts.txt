design a website for the Girls in Cyber program with information about upcoming dates,
previous presentations, photos, and the ability to embed the Google form for sign-ups.


Pages needed:






API funtionality - way for admin to add new events, show off previous presentations/photos



technical questions -- how is site going to be hosted? self hosted/aws/azure 
    


keep in mind:
next js api:
"API Routes do not specify CORS headers, meaning they are same-origin only by default. You can customize such behavior by wrapping the request handler with the CORS request helpers."
will need to specify CORS headers for ability to embed the google form for sign-ups


docker image runs on port 8082, which is could also be used by some random garbage mcaffee software, change this later for sure
